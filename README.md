# ts-type-expand for VSCode

VSCode extension that allows you to expand TypeScript type definitions.

- Displays the type information of the selected node
- This is especially useful for hard-to-read types, such as those automatically generated from GraphQL schemas.

There is nothing additional that needs to be installed.

## Supports

### Expansion

The following types can be expanded

- Properties
- Array (`T` for `Array<T>`)
- Candidate types for union type
- Arguments and return values of functions or methods

### Selection

The following are the destination nodes that support type expansion. More nodes will be added in the future.

|      Statements       | Support |
| :-------------------: | :-----: |
| TypeAlias declaration |    ✓    |
| Interface declaration |    ✓    |
| Varibale declaration  |    ✓    |
|  Varibale statement   |    ✓    |
|   Class declaration   |    ✓    |

### Types

Types are calculated by the [CompilerAPI](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Using-the-Compiler-API), so all types supported by TypeScript are supported in this extension.

### Others

- Vue is not supported (not tried)
- React also works, but there can be problems with component types

## Configure

Configure `ts-type-expand.*` to your vscode config to customize.

| `directExpandArray`     | Directly expand T for `Array<T>`                                                                        | `true`                                                               |

In order for these settings to take effect, you need to run `ts-type-expand.restart` or reload the VSCode after making the changes.

### :memo:

For debugging purposes, it is recommended to put a symbolic link to the directory where the logs are written.

```bash
$ ln -s ~/.ts-type-expand/logs ./logs
```

To start the debugger in a plain environment, you must enable `Workbench > Experimental > Settings Profile`. This setting does not exist in the per-workspace settings, only in the user settings, and must be set individually by the developer.
